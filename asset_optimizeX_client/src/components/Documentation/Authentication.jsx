        JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are a popular and secure way to implement authentication in REST APIs. They are self-contained tokens that can be used to verify the identity of a user without the need for a database lookup.
        In this document, we will discuss how to implement a secure user registration and login system using Django REST framework and JWT tokens.


        <br/>
        <br/>
        <span className='text-gradient'> User Registration</span>
        <br/>
        The user registration process is designed to prevent malicious users from creating accounts. This can be done by implementing the following measures:
        <br />
        <span className='text-rose-200'>1. </span>
            Require name, email, phone number and  strong passwords. Passwords should be at least 8 characters long. <br/>
            <span className='text-rose-200'>2. </span> Prevent duplicate usernames and email addresses. The system should prevent users from creating accounts with usernames or email addresses that are already in use. <br/>
            <span className='text-rose-200'>3. </span> Once a user has successfully register in, the system should generate a JWT token for the user. This token can then be used to authenticate the user on subsequent requests.


        <br/>
        <br/>
        <span className='text-gradient'> User Login</span>
        <br/>
        The user login process is designed to prevent unauthorized access to accounts. This can be done by implementing the following measures:
        <br />
        <span className='text-rose-200'>1. </span>
        Require Email and Password. <br/>      
        <span className='text-rose-200'>2. </span>
        The system uses a secure password hashing algorithm. This will prevent attackers from being able to steal passwords in plain text. <br/>      
            <span className='text-rose-200'>3. </span> User has successfully logged in, the system should generate a JWT token for the user. This token can then be used to authenticate the user on subsequent requests.


        <br/>
        <br/>
        <span className='text-gradient'>Forgot Password</span>
        <br/>
        The forgot password system allows users to reset their passwords if they have forgotten them. The system works by sending a verification email to the user&apos;s registered email address. The email contains a link that the user can click to reset their password.:
        <br />
        <span className='text-rose-200'>1. </span>
        The user enters their email address into the forgot password form. <br/>      
        <span className='text-rose-200'>2. </span>
        The system checks if a user with the given email address exists. <br/>      
        <span className='text-rose-200'>3. </span> If a user exists, the system generates a password reset token. <br/>
        <span className='text-rose-200'>4. </span> The system sends an email to the user&apos;s registered email address containing the password reset token. <br/>
        <span className='text-rose-200'>5. </span> The password reset token has a limited lifespan. <br/>
        <span className='text-rose-200'>6. </span> The user clicks on the link in the email to reset their password. <br/>
        <span className='text-rose-200'>7. </span> The system prompts the user to enter a new password. <br/>
        <span className='text-rose-200'>8. </span> The system updates the user&apos;s password. <br/>
        <br />
